A wonderful place to build my own blog about my incredible life (just joking)

Now let's serious..

## Git and GitHub course from Platzi

This is really a repository for practicing diferents commands and git or github's features, just to write a brief of what I've made until now

* Commits
* Push
* Branches
* Tags
* How to merge one branch to another
* How to make a pull request

And so on..

Thanks for reading! :)
